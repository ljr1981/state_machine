				Create a single MOCK_DOOR object, which will be our "test subject".
				The mock will be the thing needing its state managed. It will communicate
				with the state machine by way of pub-sub built into the state machine.
				
				The MOCK_DOOR will be a simple "door" with two states:
				
					Opened
					Closed
					 
				and two commands: 
					
					Open
					Close 
				
				where:
					
					Open -> Opened  
					Close -> Closed
				]"
