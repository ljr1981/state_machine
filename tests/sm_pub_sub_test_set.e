				Create a machine and a mock to manage. Give the machine to the
				mock and so the mock can set up its own state management through
				the given machine.
				
				Test the mock to ensure that calls to its "trigger features" has
				the desired effect (transitions fire and state changes).
				
				Test the machine to ensure that calls to its transit features
				will also cause the states to change.
