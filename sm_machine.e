		Background
		==========
		FSAs follow the Hoare Triple pattern of: {P} S {Q}, where the
		{P} and {Q} assertions evaluate to True if the machine is in a 
		particular state. The S-part represents the transition operation(s).
			
			{P} -> Assertion(s) holding True for the Start State.
			 S	-> Transition operation(s) to change (State-1 -> State-2)
			{Q}	-> Assertion(s) holding True for the Stop State.
					{P} assertion(s) will now evaluate to False.
			
		{P} /= {Q} in all S -> S'
		{P} = {Q} in all S -> S (e.g. {P} = {P} for S -> S)

		Trigger_part
		============
		A Trigger is an Subscriber Agent (A) given to a Publisher to call as a
		result of a Publisher Event (E).
		
		Event E calls Agent A, which calls S operation(s), which transitions from {P} -> {Q}.
		
		Cooperative Machines
		====================
		Machines can be in complex Publisher-Subscriber relations with each other:
		
		M1 <-> M2
		
		M1 Subscribe to M2 Event
		M2 Subscribe to M1 Event

		Context
		=======
		The {SM_MACHINE} (Current) has a single job: Manage a set of states in a State_hash
		(or objects if appropriate), facilitating the transitions between them, and proving
		the notion of `is_in_state' once a target "stable state" has been (in theory)
		achieved.
		
		The {SM_MACHINE} is NOT the thing with the set of states. A group of one-or-more
		objects in the system are the ultimate target.
		
		Extended Finite State Machine
		=============================
		"In a conventional finite state machine, the transition is associated with a set of 
		input Boolean conditions and a set of output Boolean functions. In an extended finite 
		state machine (EFSM) model, the transition can be expressed by an “if statement” consisting 
		of a set of trigger conditions. If trigger conditions are all satisfied, the transition is 
		fired, bringing the machine from the current state to the next state and performing the 
		specified data operations." -- Wikipedia
		
		As Applied Here
		---------------
		The nuance difference is subtle, but handled within the notion of an "agent queue" (i.e.
		{ACTION_SEQUENCE} and its `do_*' features).
		
		do_all (action: {PROCEDURE} [TUPLE [G]])
		do_all_with_index (action: {PROCEDURE} [TUPLE [G, INTEGER_32]])
		do_if (action: {PROCEDURE} [TUPLE [G]]; test: {FUNCTION} [TUPLE [G], BOOLEAN])
		do_if_with_index (action: {PROCEDURE} [TUPLE [G, INTEGER_32]]; test: {FUNCTION} [TUPLE [G, INTEGER_32], BOOLEAN])
		
		Of particular note are the `do_if' and `do_if_with_index' features, where the caller
		must provide a Boolean `test' {FUNCTION}. Therefore, the only agents that will "fire"
		are the ones meeting the {FUNCTION} Boolean conditions as True. If this results in a
		state change remains to be seen. However, this is true of the `do_all' variety as well,
		where just because a series of agent calls are made, we have no way to know for sure
		if the resulting state will match any of the target transitions. Also, we cannot tell if
		the current state will be maintained. This is why states must have their own conditions,
		which are measured at the completion of the transition agents to determine precisely what
		state the {SM_MACHINE} is actually in. Therefore, the E-FSM is simply an FSM with transition
		agent applied (called) conditionally.
		
		Finally--it must be noted another fine nuance between the WikiPedia description and actual
		application. In the description, the conditions must be met in order to "fire" the transitions.
		In the case of our {ACTION_SEQUENCE} agent list, we call ("fire") the transition agents based
		on a {FUNCTION} Boolean condition. This really gets to the point of: How do you want it to work?
		Do you want to:
		
		(A) Fire (call) all transition code if one-or-more conditions are met?
		(B) Fire (call) each transition agent if a condition(s) is met?
		(C) Both (A) and (B)?
		
		In the case of (C), we would build the if-then-else-end condition ahead of the agent `do_if'
		calls, supplying an appropriate Boolean condition based on the if-then and passing it to
		the `do_if', which will (in-turn) call each agent conditionally.
		
		The net result is that the (C) Both answer gives us an extreme (but complex) mechanism for
		state-transitions. This may or may not be a good idea, when it comes to debugging. Before
		building such a mechanism generally, we would want a solid use-case with a clear set of
		boundaries and specifications.
		
		State Transition Operational Boundaries
		=======================================
		If a {SM_MACHINE} has a set of transition operations (represented by agents in a queue), then
		those operations (commands) ought not be callable by clients other than the {SM_MACHINE} itself.
		Moreover, operations performed by constituent objects must treat the {SM_MACHINE} state {P} Boolean
		assertions as a set of invariants on the {SM_MACHINE}--that is--after any command operation is
		called within a state, the conditions of the {SM_MACHINE} for its particular state must not be
		violated. This isolates the state transition to only those operations held within the transition
		agent list and no other, making the state mechanism stable.

	EXTENDED_EXAMPLE: "[
		A common FSM might be suitably named as: Persistence FSM, which has notions of:
		
		* Dirty/Clean - In-memory data that matches its persisted counterpart (clean) or not (dirty).
		* Saving - The process of persisting Dirty data to a repository as a transitional state to Clean.
		* Cancelling - The process of undoing data changes in Dirty data as a transitional state to Clean.
		
				Transitions:
				============
				Clean 			-(apply_edit)> 	Dirty-valid
				Clean 			-(apply_edit)> 	Dirty-invalid
				
				Dirty-valid		-(apply_edit)>	Dirty-valid
				Dirty-valid 	-(apply_edit)> 	Dirty-invalid
				Dirty-valid 	-(save_data)> 	Clean
				Dirty-valid 	-(cancel)> 		Clean
				
				Dirty-invalid 	-(apply_edit)> 	Dirty-valid
				Dirty-invalid 	-(cancel)> 		Clean
		
		Notions of Clean and Dirty imply state {P} Boolean assertions that can test object.data features
		of some collection of objects under the control of the {SM_MACHINE} for `is_dirty'. Usually, this
		is accomplished through the facility of a "setter" (i.e. `set_*'), where the setter examines the
		incoming data to determine if the data being set differs from what is already in the "data" feature
		and (if it is) sets the `is_dirty' on the object. A call to `set_dirty'
