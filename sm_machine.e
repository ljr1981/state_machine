		Background
		==========
		FSAs follow the Hoare Triple pattern of: {P} S {Q}, where the
		precondition {P} assertions are a measure of the {SM_MACHINE} (and its
		objects) being in a particular "state". The assertions are offered
		as {P} proof of being in a "valid state". The assertions can be
		based on whatever Boolean logic is appropriate for the state.
		
		The {Q} post-conditions are the assertions applied to the post-transition
		state. Therefore, each state has a set of conditions proving that it is
		(in fact) in the state.
		
		The transition is represented by one or more Lambda functions (agents),
		which are called in-order (top-to-bottom) as or from a list. Each agent
		function is not restricted to itself, but may have one or more subsequent
		calls in the performance of its task. Regardless--the transition is a
		simple list of Lambda function agents called in top-to-bottom order.
		
		The purpose of the transition functions is to make {P} False and {Q} True.
		This says something about the assertions involved in {P} and {Q}, that they
		may not be equal, otherwise we have no transition, unless the goal is a
		transition from State A to State A through transition S', in which case
		{P} S' {P}.
		
		Overall Structure
		=================
		See BNFE "State_machine" in the Note_clause below.

		Going Further
		=============
		The BNF-E above lays out two parts required for a {SM_MACHINE}:
		
		a. A hash of `is_in_state' validating assertions to prove a state is met.
		b. A set of Transition_list agents, which move the {SM_MACHINE} from state-to-state.
		
		Trigger_part
		------------
		There is a third requirement and yet to be discussed part: The Trigger_part. The
		BNF-E of the Trigger_part is:
		
		Trigger_part ::= ???
		
		A trigger is some condition or event that impels the {SM_MACHINE} to transition from
		one state to another. Even the notion of a "condition" is implemented with an "event",
		which means that one could say we have two mechanisms: 1) Event_condition and 2) Event.
		
		EXAMPLE: Event - Mouse and other OS events, timer events, pub-sub events, and so on.
		EXAMPLE: Event_condition - A change in some participating object makes a call.
		
		Cooperatives
		------------
		Finally, there is a fourth part: The companion (suboridinate/superior) {SM_MACHINE}.
		This implies there is a cooperative relationship between {SM_MACHINE} objects. The
		BNF-E might look like:
		
		State_machine_cooperative ::=
			Primary_machine
			{Child_machine}+
			
		Informative Text
		----------------
		(1) A State_machine_coop implies another class: SM_COOPERATIVE (i.e. not coop as
			we want to ensure we are not referring to a place where chickens live).
		(2) There is a question of one-or-more parents--that is--do we have a Primary_machine
			or do we have {Parent_machine}+ (i.e. one-or-more parents)? Just because we can
			does not mean we should or ought! Complexity breeds bugs, unless based on 
			well-contracted, well-tested, and well-designed code. However, even if that is
			the case, we must ask ourselves, what does the debugging-cycle look like with
			overly complex structures?
		(3) An open question is: Does each Child_machine know about its parent? If so, this
			means that it has a reference. Is that reference strong or weak? (see Glossary).
		
		Context
		=======
		The {SM_MACHINE} (Current) has a single job: Manage a set of states in a State_hash
		(or objects if appropriate), facilitating the transitions between them, and proving
		the notion of `is_in_state' once a target "stable state" has been (in theory)
		achieved.
		
		The {SM_MACHINE} is NOT the thing with the set of states. A group of one-or-more
		objects in the system are the ultimate target.
		
		The next question becomes: Do the objects use the inheritance or client model to
		participate in the machine?
		
		Inheritance Model
		-----------------
		If the inheritance model is the chosen implementation, then the machine can have
		but one participating object--the one inheriting from {SM_MACHINE}. This means that
		for the sake of loose-coupling and diffused object cohesion, the {SM_MACHINE} is
		best when its assertions and transition operations are based only on the inheriting
		class. The use of pass-through features is not recommended.
		
		Client Model
		------------
		Using the Client Model increases the number and types of objects that can participate
		in the {SM_MACHINE} as |1 .. n|. While there are modelling advantages to this design,
		there is the downside of stronger-coupling between the {SM_MACHINE} and the objects
		it is applied to, especially if the transitions or pre and post-conditions.
		
		Extended Finite State Machine
		=============================
		"In a conventional finite state machine, the transition is associated with a set of 
		input Boolean conditions and a set of output Boolean functions. In an extended finite 
		state machine (EFSM) model, the transition can be expressed by an “if statement” consisting 
		of a set of trigger conditions. If trigger conditions are all satisfied, the transition is 
		fired, bringing the machine from the current state to the next state and performing the 
		specified data operations." -- Wikipedia
		
		As Applied Here
		---------------
		The nuance difference is subtle, but handled within the notion of an "agent queue" (i.e.
		{ACTION_SEQUENCE} and its `do_*' features).
		
		do_all (action: {PROCEDURE} [TUPLE [G]])
		do_all_with_index (action: {PROCEDURE} [TUPLE [G, INTEGER_32]])
		do_if (action: {PROCEDURE} [TUPLE [G]]; test: {FUNCTION} [TUPLE [G], BOOLEAN])
		do_if_with_index (action: {PROCEDURE} [TUPLE [G, INTEGER_32]]; test: {FUNCTION} [TUPLE [G, INTEGER_32], BOOLEAN])
		
		Of particular note are the `do_if' and `do_if_with_index' features, where the caller
		must provide a Boolean `test' {FUNCTION}. Therefore, the only agents that will "fire"
		are the ones meeting the {FUNCTION} Boolean conditions as True. If this results in a
		state change remains to be seen. However, this is true of the `do_all' variety as well,
		where just because a series of agent calls are made, we have no way to know for sure
		if the resulting state will match any of the target transitions. Also, we cannot tell if
		the current state will be maintained. This is why states must have their own conditions,
		which are measured at the completion of the transition agents to determine precisely what
		state the {SM_MACHINE} is actually in. Therefore, the E-FSM is simply an FSM with transition
		agent applied (called) conditionally.
		
		Finally--it must be noted another fine nuance between the WikiPedia description and actual
		application. In the description, the conditions must be met in order to "fire" the transitions.
		In the case of our {ACTION_SEQUENCE} agent list, we call ("fire") the transition agents based
		on a {FUNCTION} Boolean condition. This really gets to the point of: How do you want it to work?
		Do you want to:
		
		(A) Fire (call) all transition code if one-or-more conditions are met?
		(B) Fire (call) each transition agent if a condition(s) is met?
		(C) Both (A) and (B)?
		
		In the case of (C), we would build the if-then-else-end condition ahead of the agent `do_if'
		calls, supplying an appropriate Boolean condition based on the if-then and passing it to
		the `do_if', which will (in-turn) call each agent conditionally.
		
		The net result is that the (C) Both answer gives us an extreme (but complex) mechanism for
		state-transitions. This may or may not be a good idea, when it comes to debugging. Before
		building such a mechanism generally, we would want a solid use-case with a clear set of
		boundaries and specifications.
		
		State Transition Operational Boundaries
		=======================================
		If a {SM_MACHINE} has a set of transition operations (represented by agents in a queue), then
		those operations (commands) ought not be callable by clients other than the {SM_MACHINE} itself.
		Moreover, operations performed by constituent objects must treat the {SM_MACHINE} state {P} Boolean
		assertions as a set of invariants on the {SM_MACHINE}--that is--after any command operation is
		called within a state, the conditions of the {SM_MACHINE} for its particular state must not be
		violated. This isolates the state transition to only those operations held within the transition
		agent list and no other, making the state mechanism stable.

	EXTENDED_EXAMPLE: "[
		A common FSM might be suitably named as: Persistence FSM, which has notions of:
		
		* Dirty/Clean - In-memory data that matches its persisted counterpart (clean) or not (dirty).
		* Saving - The process of persisting Dirty data to a repository as a transitional state to Clean.
		* Cancelling - The process of undoing data changes in Dirty data as a transitional state to Clean.
		
		Transitions
		-----------
		(1) Clean -> Dirty
		(2) Dirty -> Saving
		(3) Saving -> Clean
		(4) Dirty -> Cancelling
		(5) Cancelling -> Clean
		
		Notions of Clean and Dirty imply state {P} Boolean assertions that can test object.data features
		of some collection of objects under the control of the {SM_MACHINE} for `is_dirty'. Usually, this
		is accomplished through the facility of a "setter" (i.e. `set_*'), where the setter examines the
		incoming data to determine if the data being set differs from what is already in the "data" feature
		and (if it is) sets the `is_dirty' on the object. A call to `set_dirty'
